# Hello, I'm Matt

## About Me
I'm deeply immersed in studying cybersecurity and cryptography, driven by a passion for academic exploration in these domains. Apart from my studies, I actively engage in bug bounty programs, hunting for vulnerabilities in various systems. Additionally, I'm a staunch advocate of open-source development, always eager to contribute to projects and collaborate with the community. I started coding in Python at the age of 13, ventured into freelance web development at 15, and now I'm fully invested in the thrilling world of cybersecurity while embracing the ethos of open-source development.
